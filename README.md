| 1 | Array              | The code is a C program that allows the user to perform various operations on an array such as finding the minimum and maximum values, calculating the average, searching for an element, and sorting the array in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm. It prompts the user to enter the size and elements of the array, and then displays a menu of options for the user to choose from. It continues to loop through the menu until the user chooses to exit the program.|[Click Here](https://github.com/smahmuddz/cse207/blob/main/Array_Min_Max_Average.c)|
| 2 | Matrix              | This is a C program that performs basic matrix operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and diagonal element addition. The program uses nested loops to read input matrices from the user and perform the requested operation. The program runs in an infinite loop until the user chooses to exit.|[Click Here](https://github.com/smahmuddz/cse207/blob/main/Matrix.c)|
| 3 | Stack              | This is a C program that implements a stack data structure. It allows the user to perform stack operations such as push, pop, and display, with an option to exit the program. The program prompts the user to enter the size of the stack, creates an array of that size, and initializes the top of the stack to -1. It then enters an infinite loop that displays a menu of stack operations and waits for user input to perform the chosen operation. Depending on the user's choice, the program performs the corresponding stack operation and displays the result or an error message if the operation is not possible due to a stack overflow or underflow.|[Click Here](https://github.com/smahmuddz/cse207/blob/main/Stack.c)|
